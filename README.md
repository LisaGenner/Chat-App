# Chat-App

Chat app built for mobile devices using React Native.  This app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

# Context
More and more people use their phones for daily tasks, such as shopping, creating to-do lists,
communicating with friends, scheduling meetings, etc. That's why many companies offer native
mobile versions of their web apps or even skip creating a web app entirely.
In the past, building high-quality mobile apps required a lot of time and money because writing apps
for different platforms like iOS and Android required specialized programmers who could build and
maintain multiple codebases.
Over time, however, new technologies emerged that made it easier for companies to build and
maintain mobile applications using familiar syntax. One of these technologies is React Native, a
framework for building Android and iOS apps that only requires one codebase.


1. Who—The users of the mobile chat app. These could be friends, family or other
students on this course. Your codebase will be used by other developers working on
the product. 

2. What—A native chat app built with React Native, as well as all the relevant
documentation.

3. When—Whenever users of your chat app want to communicate with each other.
 
4. Where—The app will be optimized for both Android and iOS devices. You will use
Expo to develop the app and Google Firestore to store the chat messages.

5. Why—Mobile chat apps are among the most commonly downloaded and used apps
in the world, so knowing how to build a chat app is an essential skill. The app
will demonstrate your React Native development skills.

# Technical Requirements

Written in React Native

Developed using Expo

Chat conversations are stored in Google Firestore Database.
 
The app authenticates users anonymously via Google Firebase authentication.

Chat conversations are stored locally.

The app will allow users pick and send images from the phone’s image library.

The app will allow users to take pictures with the device’s camera app, and send them.

The app will store images in Firebase Cloud Storage.

The app reads the user’s location data.

Location data will be sent via the chat in a map view.

The chat interface and functionality are created using the Gifted Chat library.

The app’s codebase contains comments.
